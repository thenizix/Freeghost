# Freeghost Project Log

## Missing Features and Components

1. **Storage Layer**
   - Distributed storage is 80% complete; needs finalization.
   - State synchronization is incomplete.
   - Recovery mechanisms need to be implemented.

2. **Network Layer**
   - Advanced routing strategies are not yet implemented.
   - Circuit breaker and load balancing need completion.

3. **Documentation**
   - Architecture, API, and deployment documentation are missing or incomplete.

## Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Ensure coverage for core cryptography, network protocols, and storage operations.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - P2P networking, tor, state synchronization, and distributed storage need thorough testing.

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Conduct throughput measurements, latency analysis, and resource utilization tests.

## Additional Needs

1. **Dependencies**
   - Ensure all required dependencies are installed, including Solana SDK and libp2p tor etc...

2. **Configuration**
   - Verify configuration files for network and blockchain settings.

3. **Deployment**
   - Prepare deployment scripts and documentation for setting up the node.

## Next Steps

1. **High Priority**
   - Complete distributed storage consensus and state synchronization.
   - Implement advanced routing and load balancing.

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Finalize integration tests and deployment documentation.

3. **Low Priority**
   - Optimize performance and enhance monitoring capabilities.

This log serves as a guide to address the remaining tasks and ensure the Freeghost node is fully functional and ready for deployment.
